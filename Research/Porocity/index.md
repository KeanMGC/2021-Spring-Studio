### Porosity + City ###
<br>
_How to open up our solid towers?_
<br>
Our current cities are comprised of enclosed, distant and introverted architecture equally isolated from urban life and ecological context.

### HISTOTICAL RESEARCH
<br>
<br>
**THE ARCADES** PROJECT by Walter Benjamin
<br><br>
No previous articulation of the porous nature of architecture however, has ever conceived of or classified a type of architectural permeability, which has arteries of a new classification of space. This new type of space is between public and private
<br><br>

<br><br>


**THE LEAP INTO THE VOID** PROJECT by Ives Klein
<br><br>
When Ives Klein performed “The Leap into the Void” in 1967, from a brick wall adjacent to the street, he rendered the architecture impotent in relation to the act. In other words, architecture, although deemed solid and eternally strong is actually very weak and plastic by comparison with the idea as represented through performance.

**RAISE BY GOODWIN**
<br><br>
Goodwin has found “what a building desires” to do next in its determination to facilitate new technologies, new building-to-building connections and demands on its program.

**Aesthetics**
<br><br>
Porosity can be understood as a medium: they allow substances to pass through, such as ensuring photosynthesis of plants and human sweating. Therefore, from the urban perspective, porosity is essential for maintaining health and sustainability. They are built-in media that regulate circulation and exchange, balance inequality, and ensure the sustainability of cities.

**Method of calculating "porocity"**
<br><br>
**VOXEL**
<br><br>
In 3D computer graphics, a voxel represents a value on a regular grid in three-dimensional space. As with pixels in a 2D bitmap, voxels themselves do not typically have their position (ie coordinates) explicitly encoded with their values. Instead, rendering systems infer the position of a voxel based upon its position relative to other voxels.

### Theory – Discrete Arch.

<br>
<br>
**Discrete in architecture** 
<br><br>
-This terminology derives from the method call discrete manufacturing, which is a way of manufacturing products and elements in orders for it to have a singular purpose only.
<br>
-The process of Discrete Manufacturing will allow for the usage of only required materials to the exact specifications in order to make the product work.

Digital materials**
<br>
**-Reversible**

**Discreteness & Automation**
<br><br>
Use robotic to connect discrete architecture and construction
<br><br>
Can accelerate the process to assemble the architectural system

**LEGO-LIKE WOODEN PAVILION** BY GILLES RETSIN
<br><br>
Exterior plywood (3.3 x 1.35 m)
<br>
Over 380 m2 of plywood was cut and assembled into 80 building blocks.
<br>
The blocks can be quickly assembled on site, using only a set of ratchet-spanners and bolts.
<br>
The digital workflow behind the pavilion enables a low-cost, fast and open production-chain.
