#### HISTOTICAL RESEARCH
<br>
**THE ARCADES** PROJECT by Walter Benjamin
<br>
No previous articulation of the porous nature of architecture however, has ever conceived of or classified a type of architectural permeability, which has arteries of a new classification of space. This new type of space is between public and private

**THE LEAP INTO THE VOID** PROJECT by Ives Klein
<br>

In other words, architecture, although deemed solid and eternally strong is actually very weak and plastic by comparison with the idea as represented through a performance.
