### History
History: Stacking house
Stackable homes: In the movie, in 2045, the economic crisis, the energy crisis, and the cyber crisis have turned the world into a world of slums. Watts makes his real-world home in a dystopian version of Columbus, where mobile homes are layered on top of each other to form “the Stacks” --made up of steel frames and shipping containers. About this concept, it can be dated back to the beginning of 20th century.
<br>
**1909 theorem**<br>
<br><img alt="The Stacks" src="https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/gh-pages/Research/Stacking/1909-theorem.jpg?raw=true" width="300"><br>
In this figure, Rem koolhaas showed an eighty-four stories, high steel framework or a “rack” that could produce unlimited numbers of sites stacked on a single plot. Each of the sites independent from one another as if it is isolated. It proposed a new conception of relationships between the parts and the whole. From the perpective of the urban, this meant that particular plot could no longer be matched with a concrete purpose and function.<br>
**1960: Nakagin Capsule Tower**<br>
<br><img alt="The Stacks" src="https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/gh-pages/Research/Stacking/1960-Nakagin%20Capsule%20Tower.jpg?raw=true" width="300"><br>
After World War II, Japanese used “Metabolism” to describe their beliefs about how buildings and cities should be designed, mimic a living being.A well-known example of Metabolism in architecture is Kurokawa's Nakagin Capsule Tower in Tokyo. They used concrete as structure to separate different units.<br>

**1981: SITE, High-Rise of Homes**<br>
<br><img alt="The Stacks" src="https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/gh-pages/Research/Stacking/1981-Site,%20High%20rise%20of%20homes-2.jpg?raw=true" width="300"><br>
This housing structure offers apartment residence a unique advantages of garden space and personalized architectural identity in a multi-story apartment. The building is a steel and concrete matrix supporting a vertical community.

### Theoretical
#### The Vertical Village
Exhibition at Museum of Tomorrow in Taipei (5 Oct 2011 - 8 Jan 2012)
<br><img alt="The Stacks" src="https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/gh-pages/Research/Stacking/vertical%20village%20exhibition-1.jpg?raw=true" width="300"><br>
<img alt="The Stacks" src="https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/gh-pages/Research/Stacking/vertical%20village-exhibition-2.jpg?raw=true" width="300"><br>
“The Vertical Village” exhibition explored the topic of rapid urban transformation in East Asia, the qualities of urban villages and the potential to realize this in a much denser, vertical way as a radical alternative to the identical block architecture with standard apartments and its consequences for the city. 
<br>
**Who is vertical village for?**<br>
The vertical village exhibition offers a parametric tool for a developer to create an environment that is an alternative to the "Block Attack". The tool will help the developer to bring personal freedom, diversity, flexibility and neighborhood life back into East Asian cities, and yet the tool can also contribute to the discussion in a European context. <br>
**Why is vertical village important?**<br>
<img alt="The Stacks" src="https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/gh-pages/Research/Stacking/vertical%20village-diagram-1.jpg?raw=true" width="500"><br>The vertical village is a study of how dense environment can still maintain their identity. It looks at whether the villages can be densified in such a way that the qualities of traditional village are preserved and enriched.Wego: Adaptation of Housing in Future Cities.
Based on the hypothesis of maximum density achievement and maximum desire fulfillment, the book of The Why Factory’s “Future Cities” series explores the potentials of desire-based design processes, capable of introducing the residents’ wishes in the construction and adaptation of housing and the city.

It mediates between the momentary desires of its inhabitants and the need for collectiveness. It is a chaotic tangle of apartments of all different shapes that adapt in real-time to meet their inhabitant’s needs, (W)ego City describes a future in which living spaces are constantly negotiated for the collective benefit.<br>
Moreover, it can optimize land use. help combat inequality and counteract the force condemning urban development to urban sprawl.



### Technical
**The Stacks**
<br>
<img alt="The Stacks" src="https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/gh-pages/Research/Stacking/the%20stacks-drawing.jpg?raw=true" width="500"><br>
This building is made by dozens of trailers and similar mobile living quarters, and they are stacked on top of each other, held together by metal beams, pipes and makeshift girders. But considering the economic situation and whole context settled in the film, this is a good way to save space, labor, money and resources, even though it is overcrowded. <br>

#### First example
**SALÓN VERDE, MVRDV, Madrid, Spain, 2021**
<br>
<img alt="MVRDV" src="https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/gh-pages/Research/Stacking/mvrdv%20public-1.jpg?raw=true" width="500"><br>
The problem of this site is how to transform the financial sector into an open and sustainable urban space for the city. So the main strategy of the architect is to create a green “living room” for the city, they apply a multi-story frame structure to add a new way to experience the district and use water pools and trees to adapt to the seasons change. 
<br>

<img alt="MCRDV" src="https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/gh-pages/Research/Stacking/mvrdv%20public%20diagram-1.jpg?raw=true" width="500"><br>
The first step they did is to demolish all redundant structures such as pavement, stairs, ramps to improve the quality of the lower street levels. The whole context here is reorganized and surrounded by trees and  pools to adjust the climate there. 
<br>

<img alt="MCRDV" src="https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/gh-pages/Research/Stacking/mvrdv%20public%20diagram-2.jpg?raw=true" width="500"><br>
The most distinguished structure here is the multi-level prefabricated structure around the plaza. Together with different species of trees on each level, the structure creates dramatic shade and sunlit terraces for lounging throughout the year. 

#### Second example
**Church + Wellesley, 3XN, Toronto, Canada, 2019**
<br>
<img alt="3NX" src="https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/gh-pages/Research/Stacking/3xn%20rendering.jpg?raw=true" width="250"><br>
<img alt="3NX" src="https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/gh-pages/Research/Stacking/3xn%20diagram.jpg?raw=true" width="500"><br>
<img alt="3NX" src="https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/gh-pages/Research/Stacking/3xn_church_and_wellesley_08_diagram.jpg?raw=true" width="500"><br>
The tower is divided into four separate masses, literally called “vertical village”. The building has two identities, one for the Church street, which is low-rise and retail, another is for the urban street, more conventional tall building reflecting the urban development.
