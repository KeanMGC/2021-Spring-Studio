The Stacks<br>

This building is made by dozens of trailers and similar mobile living quarters, and they are stacked on top of each other, held together by metal beams, pipes and makeshift girders. But considering the economic situation and whole context settled in the film, this is a good way to save space, labor, money and resources, even though it is overcrowded. <br>

#### First example
SALÓN VERDE, MVRDV, Madrid, Spain, 2021
<br>
<img alt="MVRDV" src="https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/gh-pages/Research/Stacking/mvrdv%20public-1.jpg?raw=true" width="500"><br>
The problem of this site is how to transform the financial sector into an open and sustainable urban space for the city. So the main strategy of the architect is to create a green “living room” for the city, they apply a multi-story frame structure to add a new way to experience the district and use water pools and trees to adapt to the seasons change.

The first step they did is to demolish all redundant structures such as pavement, stairs, ramps to improve the quality of the lower street levels. The whole context here is reorganized and surrounded by trees and  pools to adjust the climate there.

The most distinguished structure here is the multi-level prefabricated structure around the plaza. Together with different species of trees on each level, the structure creates dramatic shade and sunlit terraces for lounging throughout the year. 

#### Second example
Church + Wellesley, 3XN, Toronto, Canada, 2019
<br>
<img alt="3NX" src="https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/gh-pages/Research/Stacking/3xn%20rendering.jpg?raw=true" width="250"><br>
<img alt="3NX" src="https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/gh-pages/Research/Stacking/3xn%20diagram.jpg?raw=true" width="500"><br>
<img alt="3NX" src="https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/gh-pages/Research/Stacking/3xn_church_and_wellesley_08_diagram.jpg?raw=true" width="500"><br>
The tower is divided into four separate masses, literally called “vertical village”. The building has two identities, one for the Church street, which is low-rise and retail, another is for the urban street, more conventional tall building reflecting the urban development.
