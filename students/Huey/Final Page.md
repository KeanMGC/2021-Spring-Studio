## Historic Research

### Man-made closed ecological

Man-made closed ecological systems which were created to sustain human life include 
Biosphere 2, MELiSSA, and the BIOS-1, BIOS-2, and BIOS-3 projects.

Bottle gardens and aquarium ecospheres are partially or fully enclosed glass containers that 
are self-sustaining closed ecosystems that can be made or purchased. They can include tiny 
shrimp, algae, gravel, decorative shells, and gorgonia.





Biosphere2

The previous examples are all attempts by humans to close the ecosystem. But they have 
some limitations, such as being too small and not long lasting.
Imagine that if humans will one day move to space and build cities in space, then its scale 
must be large enough to carry enough people, and its ecosystem must be sustainable.Why 
this project is called Biosphere2, what is Biosphere1, well Biosphere is the earth. The earth 
meets all the conditions of a closed ecosystem. It only accepts heat from the sun, and there 
is almost no energy exchange with the outside
