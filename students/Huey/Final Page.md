## Historic Research

### Man-made closed ecological

Man-made closed ecological systems which were created to sustain human life include 
Biosphere 2, MELiSSA, and the BIOS-1, BIOS-2, and BIOS-3 projects.

Bottle gardens and aquarium ecospheres are partially or fully enclosed glass containers that 
are self-sustaining closed ecosystems that can be made or purchased. They can include tiny 
shrimp, algae, gravel, decorative shells, and gorgonia.

### In fiction

The 1993 novel This Other Eden by Ben Elton featured the development of "claustrospheres" which were closed ecological systems contained within a dome in which people could take refuge in the event of environmental collapse.

The critically panned 1996 comedy film Bio-Dome involved the protagonists becoming trapped in a closed ecological system being run as an experiment.

## Technical&Theoretical Research
### Closed ecological systems (CES)

Closed ecological systems (CES) are ecosystems that do not rely on matter exchange with any part outside the system.

The term is most often used to describe small manmade ecosystems. Such systems are scientifically interesting and can potentially serve as a life support system during space flights, in space stations or space habitats.

### Rotating wheel space station

Such a station would rotate about its axis, thus creating an environment of artificial gravity. Occupants of the station would experience centripetal acceleration.

In theory, the station could be configured to simulate the gravitational acceleration of Earth (9.81 m/s2), allowing for human long stays in space without the drawbacks of microgravity.

## Precedent Examples
### Biosphere2

The previous examples are all attempts by humans to close the ecosystem. But they have 
some limitations, such as being too small and not long lasting.
Imagine that if humans will one day move to space and build cities in space, then its scale 
must be large enough to carry enough people, and its ecosystem must be sustainable.Why 
this project is called Biosphere2, what is Biosphere1, well Biosphere is the earth. The earth 
meets all the conditions of a closed ecosystem. It only accepts heat from the sun, and there 
is almost no energy exchange with the outside
