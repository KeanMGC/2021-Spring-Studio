## Personal Introduction


### 1. Introduction

I am a senior studying architecture at [WKU](https://wku.edu.cn/). I have a wide range of hobbies, and I have a strong interest in architecture and philosophy. I am an idealist. I often have strange ideas and apply them to my study. I am compassionate, I love the world, and I want to use my life to make others happy.
