In Jinhua, Zhejiang, brown sugar twist is a specialty of Yiwu, which is made of brown sugar juice and twist. Among them, the brown sugar twist is the best. Twist is delicious, and the essence is in brown sugar. Yiwu has a history of brown sugar for hundreds of years, which can be traced back to the Shunzhi period of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1661), with a history of more than 340 years. According to historical records, at the beginning, Jia Weicheng (1604-1670), a native of Yanli Village of Fotang, visited Minyue and taught people to cultivate sugarcane in the style of sugar carts. Now the brown sugar production skills have been included in the list of intangible cultural heritage.

**DESCRIPTION**<br>

This site is on a special terrain. There are two roads separated here. The two separated roads both extend towards the mountain, and the three areas separated by the two roads also have different heights. That is to say, the site extends upward in both directions.<br>

The architecture is a cook school, I keep the two main road as the main circulation, towards the mountain, the process of the cooking the dish will be showed to everybody towards the main road step by step through the room with one another. The building mainly uses arches as the basic architectural element. The idea come from the dish – brown sugar twist. Twist is a dough made from flour, made into strips, folded in half, rotated, folded in half, and rotated again. Its section is always composed of side-by-side circles. The idea of the architecture just come from that.<br>

The main material is concrete, with the glass facade. i hope that the processwill be shown in a open space, everyone pass thought can can enjoy it. But if someone is not interested in the cooking process, they can also just walk away along the open open staircase. The staircase are the main and most important pattern, it is the main circulation to climb the hill, also the main circulation in the architecture.<br>
