The site is a small island near the north gate of SanYang Wetland. There are many birds live in the small island. The project including a birdwatching house, a view tower, a wharf and some structure for bird nest. People come to this island by boats. The project is closed, make sure people will not bother the lives of birds, visitors can choose to watch birds in the low birdwatching house or come to the high view Tower along the winding path to enjoy the beautiful views of SanYang Wetland, and on the ground of view Tower, there is a ground window, visitors can enjoy the view of this island and the birds through it. in the island, I set some small structures in different heights, for birds. I hope the birds on make the nests on these structures or under it, and visitors can watch the birds easily. And the different height is built for different kinds of birds.
