**Urban condition:**

Large size and high density of population; Heterogeneity; Formality of relations; Social distance; Regimentation; Segmentation of personality…
“Big crowds and busy streets do not always help to create a sense of connectedness; for many city residents, they actively contribute to feelings of alienation. Rapid urbanization is exacerbating this challenge as walkable spaces shrink, parking lots replace playgrounds, and high-rises eclipse neighborhoods—all of which make it increasingly difficult to maintain a healthy sense of community and belonging. New arrivals, especially immigrant populations who may not speak the language, can struggle to establish a sense of belonging amidst the crowd.”

**Two interrelated challenges for housing:**

Social isolation and environmental sustainability.

**Aspects to consider：**

Distribution of public and private spaces;
Ventilation and lighting;
Transportation and communication.
